## terraform-aws-ecs - 6.0.0
FEATURES
- Adding efs and ebs kms key variables
- Parameter `kms_key_arn` no longer available

‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES AND HOW TO FIX ‚ö†Ô∏è 

The parameter `kms_key_arn` has been split into `efs_key_arn` and `ebs_key_arn` so it resource can use its own kms key.
If you are not using `kms_key_arn` variable the upgrade will not break the state.

 **EFS key change will cause terraform to recreate EFS resources**
