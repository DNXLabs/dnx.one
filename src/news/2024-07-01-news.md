## terraform-aws-opensearch - 1.0.0
## What's Changed
* add variables for security options  and endpoint creation by @Rasmnev in https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-opensearch/pull/18
* cluster_version now receives full version name instead of OpenSearch version number

### **Beaking Change**
Previously this variable only allowed for the use of OpenSearch distributions because it was used like this:
`elasticsearch_version = "OpenSearch_${var.cluster_version}"`
In order to use ElasticSearch opensource versions available in AWS the `cluster_version` variable should now include the full version name: 
- ElasticSearch 7.10 -> `cluster_version = "7.10"
- OpenSearch 2.0 -> `cluster_version = "OpenSearch_2.0"

## New Contributors
* @Rasmnev made their first contribution in https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-opensearch/pull/14
