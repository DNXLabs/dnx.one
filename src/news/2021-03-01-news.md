## laravel-queue-aws-batch - v3.0.6
Bug fix for dispatching single job ID, previously the framework was relying on the pop() method from the DatabaseQueue class and the Job ID forwarded to the Batch driver was not used in the selection logic, this bug fix updates the method name responsible to handle the console dispatch in Laravel 6.x and fixes the Batch driver allowing to select a specific Job ID.
