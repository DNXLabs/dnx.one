## terraform-aws-ecr - 1.0.0
## What's Changed

* Enable KMS encryption and capability of using customer-managed key by @lzrocha in https://github.com/DNXLabs/terraform-aws-ecr/pull/10 
 ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** ⚠️ 
This may destroy and recreate ECR repositories that have been created with previous module releases. 
Now, ECR repositories will be encrypted with KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) by default instead of the Amazon S3-managed encryption at rest. When you use AWS KMS to encrypt your data, you can either use the default AWS managed key, which is managed by Amazon ECR, or enable an AWS customer-managed key.
