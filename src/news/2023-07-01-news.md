## terraform-aws-api-gateway - 1.16.0

## What’s Changed

<details>
  <summary>Fix support for proxy-based REST APIs @matthosking-mydeal (#3)</summary>

This pull request completes the work for enabling VPC link REST APIs, as well as making it possible to support proxy paths so that the path can be passed through to the underlying APIs. Adding support for the root resource allows using an API gateway per API, instead of a single instance with paths.

## Types of changes

- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)

## Checklist

- [x] I have read the CONTRIBUTING.md doc.
- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate).
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules.

## Further comments

Sample usage of the module for a REST API that's using proxy for VPC link (including proxy paths):

```

        integration_uri  = "https://${try(env_app.app.hostname, env_app.app.name)}.${try(local.workspace.eb_app.use_master_hosted_zone, false) ? local.workspace.master_hosted_zone : local.workspace.hosted_zone}/"
        route_mapping    = null

        route_mapping    = "{proxy+}"
        path_parameters  = ["proxy"]
        connection_type  = try(each.value.connection_type, "VPC_LINK")
      }
  ]])
