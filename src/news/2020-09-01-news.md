## terraform-aws-network - 1.3.0

• A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
